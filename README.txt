Wheather_Now - Modern Blue Theme
-------------------------------

What I included:
- Simple React + Vite app using Open-Meteo API (no API key required)
- Modern blue theme, responsive layout, loader, and dynamic icons
- Footer credit with your name

How to run:
1. Open a terminal and cd into this project folder (where package.json is)
   Example:
     cd "C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\Wheather_Now_final"

2. Install dependencies:
     npm install

3. Start the dev server:
     npm run dev

4. Open the local URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- If you prefer a different icon set (SVGs) or a background animation, tell me and I will add.
- The app title is "Wheather_Now" as you requested.
